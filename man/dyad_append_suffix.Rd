\description{
Appends a designated character string ("suffix") to all variables in a given dataframe except for identifying column variables. Identifying column variables include country names, identifiers, and abbreviations, and year.
This function is designed to allow researchers to append suffixes to differentiate between variables in a combined dataset based on their dataset of origin.
For example, "COW" could be appended as a suffix to variables from the Correlates of War dataset.
